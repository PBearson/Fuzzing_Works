SUMMARY: Programs that accept structured inputs normally operate in 3 stages: 1) parse the syntax of the input; 2) check the syntax of the input; 3) execute the application. Deep bugs are often hidden in the final step. However, mutation-based fuzzing typically fails at step 1, while generation-based fuzzing may fail at step 2. In this paper, the authors propose Skyfire, a data-driven seed generation approach. Skyfire takes a corpus and a grammar as input and generates a probabilistic context-sensitive grammar (PCSG), which specifies syntax features and semantic rules about the inputs. From this, the fuzzer generates seed inputs according to production rules in the PCSG, with a priority of low-probability production rules over high-probability production rules for producing uncommon inputs. To reduce redundancy, Skyfire uses seed selection to filter out seeds that have the same code coverage. The mutation strategy introduces semantic changes that maintains grammar structures. The seeds generated by Skyfire were fed to AFL to fuzz XSLT and XML engines, and Internet Explorer 11's JavaScript rendering engine. The authors found 19 new memory corruption bus and 32 new denial-of-service bugs.
