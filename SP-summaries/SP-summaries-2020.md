SUMMARY: The state space of programs presents grand challenges to fuzz testers. For example, the state of a program can often change even as previously discovered paths are re-explored. Thus, fuzzers that focus solely on code coverage, but not state space, may not discover deep vulnerabilities with complex state machines. Moreover, the state space of a program can grow quite large, which limits complex solutions such as symbolic execution. In this paper, the authors propose Ijon, a fuzzer that enables manual annotations from humans to help guide the fuzzing process. Ijon allows human analysts the annotate the feedback function of the fuzzer, which can help explore more interesting and complex behaviors. The authors extended various AFL-based fuzzers with Ijon. These fuzzers could then efficiently explore the state spaces of Super Mario Bros., a maze, and software emulation of a TPM module, and a hash map implementation.
